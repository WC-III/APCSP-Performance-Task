Yeah, this is my APCSP PT submission, available for all to see.
It's quite simple, download the .zip and run APCSP.exe for Windows and APSCP for Linux, just do it in a terminal.

Downloading the necessary archive:
1. Go to the sidebar and click on the `v1.0.0` icon
2. Click on `net8.0.zip`, which will download it.
3. Extract the zip archive.
4. Run the necessary program.

If you don't have .NET SDK 8.0 or higher, then you'll need it. Otherwise, it's as easy as running the program.
